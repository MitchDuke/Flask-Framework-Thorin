        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in
                his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug,
                in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle
                of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's
                East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on
                the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

                nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
                feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

                Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
                brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
                Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
                Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
                2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
                Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

                Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the
                death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five
                Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

                and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
                to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
                new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

                Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
                Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
                though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
                the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
                was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
                quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
                loss of Thráin II.

                Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in
                The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
                Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One
                Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his
                adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo
                Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo and Primula, drowned in the Brandywine River.
